# E-Commerce Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project involves an in-depth analysis of e-commerce data using Python and SQL within Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to extract valuable insights from the dataset through a series of queries, covering basic, intermediate, and advanced levels of analysis. This analysis provides a comprehensive view of customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
- **SQL**: For querying and aggregating e-commerce data.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For creating and documenting the analysis workflow.

## Data

The dataset used in this project includes e-commerce transaction data with details about orders, payments, customers, and products.

## Queries Solved

   - Extracted unique customer cities from the dataset.

2. **Count the number of orders placed in 2017**:
   - Calculated the total number of orders for the year 2017.

3. **Find the total sales per category**:
   - Aggregated sales data by product category to determine total sales for each category.

4. **Calculate the percentage of orders that were paid in installments**:
   - Computed the proportion of orders paid in installments versus those paid in full.

5. **Count the number of customers from each state**:
   - Determined the number of customers per state.

### Intermediate Queries

1. **Calculate the number of orders per month in 2018**:
   - Analyzed order data to count the number of orders for each month of 2018.

2. **Find the average number of products per order, grouped by customer city**:
   - Calculated the average number of products ordered per transaction, segmented by customer city.

3. **Calculate the percentage of total revenue contributed by each product category**:
   - Evaluated the revenue contribution of each product category as a percentage of total revenue.

4. **Identify the correlation between product price and the number of times a product has been purchased**:
   - Analyzed the relationship between product price and purchase frequency.

5. **Calculate the total revenue generated by each seller, and rank them by revenue**:
   - Aggregated and ranked sellers based on the total revenue they generated.

### Advanced Queries

1. **Calculate the moving average of order values for each customer over their order history**:
   - Computed the moving average of order values for each customer to track spending trends.

2. **Calculate the cumulative sales per month for each year**:
   - Aggregated sales data to determine cumulative sales by month for each year.

3. **Calculate the year-over-year growth rate of total sales**:
   - Analyzed sales data to compute the annual growth rate.

4. **Calculate the retention rate of customers, defined as the percentage of customers who make another purchase within 6 months of their first purchase**:
   - Evaluated customer retention by measuring repeat purchases within a 6-month window.

5. **Identify the top 3 customers who spent the most money in each year**:
   - Ranked customers based on their spending, identifying the top three for each year.
